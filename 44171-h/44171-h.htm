<p class="f150 space-below1"><i>Honorable Hubert Work, Postmaster General.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Honorable Hubert Work</span>, Postmaster-General,
was a practising physician for many years in Colorado prior to entering government service,
and was also President of the American Medical Association. He served as first assistant
postmaster-general under Postmaster-General Will H. Hays, his predecessor, who, upon
assuming management of the Post-office Department, practically dedicated it as an institution
for service and not for politics or profit. Since that time all possible efforts have been
made to humanize it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The administration of Mr. Hays was ably assisted
by Mr. Work who had direct supervision
of the 52,000 post-offices and more than two-thirds
of all postal workers. By persistent efforts
to build up the spirit of the great army of postal
workers and bring the public and the post-office
into closer contact and more intimate relationship,
the postal system has been placed at last on a
footing of <i>service to the public</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Mr. Work is an exponent of a business
administration of the postal service, and representatives
of the larger business organizations and Chambers
of Commerce, from time to time, are called into
conference, in order that the benefit of their suggestions
and their experience may be obtained
and their fullest co-operation enlisted in the campaign
for postal improvement.</p>

<h2>Statement Prepared for the<br />Manufacturers Trust Company</h2>
<p class="f110"><span class="smcap">By Honorable Hubert Work, postmaster-general</span></p>

<p class="indent">The need for a more general understanding of
the purpose of the postal establishment, its internal
workings and the problems of operation,
is paramount if it is to afford the ultimate service which
it is prepared to render.</p>

<p class="indent">The business man, whose success is definitely
connected with its smooth operation, especially should be
concerned with the directions for its use. The post-office
functions automatically, so far as he is concerned,
after he drops the letter into the slot; but before this
stage is reached, a certain amount of preparation is
necessary. He could scarcely expect to operate an
intricate piece of machinery without first learning the
various controls, and no more is it to be expected that
he can secure the utmost benefit from such a diversified
utility as the postal service without knowing how
to use the parts at his disposal.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly our efforts have been directed to the
circulation of essential postal information, and with the
aid of the public press and the co√∂peration of persons
and organizations using the service, the people throughout
the country are now better informed on postal affairs
than at any time in its history.</p>

<p class="indent">The recognition of the human element is a
recent forward step in postal administration. Although the
post-office has probably been the most powerful aid to
the development of a social consciousness, the management
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
until recently seems to have overlooked the relative
value of the individual in the postal organism.</p>

<p class="indent">The individual postal worker is now considered
to be the unit, and the effort to maintain the service at a high
standard of efficiency is based upon the betterment of
his physical environment and the encouragement of
the spirit of partnership by enlisting his intelligent interest
in the problems of management and recognizing
his real value to the postal organization. Suggestions
for improvement are invited and considered from those
within the service as well as those without, and it is
believed that a full measure of usefulness will not be
attained until the American public, which in this sense
includes the postal workers themselves, are convinced
that the service belongs to them.</p>

<h2>GENERAL OFFICERS OF THE<br /> POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT</h2>

<p class="indent">The postmaster-general is assisted in the
administration of the Post-office Department by four assistant
postmasters-general. The first assistant postmaster-general
has supervision over the postmasters, post-office
clerks, and city letter carriers at all post-offices, as well
as the general management of the postal business of
those offices, the collection, delivery, and preparation
of mail for despatch. The second assistant postmaster-general
is concerned entirely with the transportation of
mail by rail (both steam and electric), by air, and by
water. He supervises the railway mail, air mail, foreign
mail services, and adjusts the pay for carrying the mail.
The third assistant postmaster-general is the financial
official of the department and has charge of the money-order
and registry service, the distribution of postage-stamps,
and the classification of mail matter. The
fourth assistant postmaster-general directs the operation
of the rural delivery service, the distribution of
supplies, and the furnishing of equipment for the post-offices
and railway mail service.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In addition to the four assistants there
is a solicitor, or legal officer; a chief post-office inspector, who has
jurisdiction over the traveling inspectors engaged in
inspecting, tracing lost mail, and investigating mail
depredations, or other misuse of the mail; a purchasing
agent; a chief clerk, who supervises the clerical force
at headquarters in Washington; and a controller, who
audits the accounts of the 52,000 postmasters.

<p class="center space-above1"><i>The Post-office of General Concern</i></p>

<p class="indent">There is no governmental activity that comes so
uniformly into intimate daily contact with different classes
of this country's inhabitants, nor one the functioning
of which touches practically the country's entire population,
as does the United States postal system. Mr.
Daniel G. Roper, in a volume highly regarded by postal
executives, entitled "The United States Post-Office,"
called the postal service "the mightiest instrument of
human democracy." This system, as we know it to-day,
represents the growth, development, and improvement
of over a century and a third. In the last seventy-five
years this growth has been particularly marked;
the total number of pieces of all kinds of mail matter
handled in 1847, for instance, was 124,173,480; in 1913
it was estimated that 18,567,445,160 pieces were handled,
and to-day about 1,500,000,000 letters are handled
every hour in the postal service. In 1790 the gross
postal revenues were $38,000 in round numbers and the
expenditures $32,000. In 1840 the revenues were $4,543,500
and expenditures $4,718,200. In 1890 the
revenues were $60,880,000 and the expenditures $66,260,000.
In 1912 the revenues were $247,000,000 and
the expenditures $248,500,000.</p>

<p class="indent">The revenue of the postal service for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1921, including fees from money-orders
and profits from postal-savings business, amounted to
$463,491,274.70, an increase of $26,341,062.37 over the
receipts for the preceding fiscal year, which were $437,150,212.33.
The rate of increase in receipts for 1921
over 1920 was 6.02 per cent., as compared with an increase
in 1920 over 1919 of 19.81 per cent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The audited expenditures for the year were
$620,993,673.65, an increase over the preceding year of
$166,671,064.44, the rate of increase being 36.68 per
cent. The audited expenditures for the fiscal year were
therefore in excess of the revenues in the sum of $157,502,398.95,
to which should be added losses of postal
funds, by fire, burglary, and other causes, amounting to
$15,289.16, making a total audited deficiency in postal
revenues of $157,517,688.11. The material increase in
the deficiency over that for 1920 was due to large increases
of expenditures made necessary by reason of
the re-classification act allowing increased compensation
estimated at $41,855,000 to postal employees, and
to increased allowances of more than $30,000,000 for
railroad mail transportation resulting from orders of
the Interstate Commerce Commission under authority
of Congress.</p>

<p class="indent">The revenues of this department are accounted for
to the Treasury of the United States and the postmaster-general
submits to Congress itemized estimates of
amounts necessary under different classifications; Congress,
in turn, makes appropriations as it deems advisable.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In 1790 there were a total of 118 officers,
postmasters, and employees of all kinds in the postal service.
Postmaster-General Work to-day directs the activities
of nearly 326,000 officers and employees. The number
of post-offices in the United States in 1790 was seventy-five;
in 1840 the number had increased to 13,468; in
1890 it was 62,401; and on January 1, 1922, there were
52,050. The greatest number of post-offices in existence
at one time was 76,945, in 1901, but the extension
of rural delivery since its establishment in 1896 has
caused, and will probably continue to cause, a gradual
decrease in the number of smaller post-offices.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Post-office in Colonial Times</i></p>

<p class="indent">The first Colonial postmaster, Richard Fairbanks,
conducted an office in a house in Boston in 1639 to receive
letters from ships. In 1672 Governor Lovelace of New
York arranged for a monthly post between New York
and Boston, which appears to have been the first post-route
officially established in America. Much of this
route was through wilderness, and the postman blazed
the trees on his way so that travelers might follow his
path. This route, however, was soon abandoned.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1673 the Massachusetts General Court provided
for certain payments to post messengers, although the
first successful postal system established in any of the
Colonies was that of William Penn, who, in 1683, appointed
Henry Waldy to keep a post, supply passengers
with horses, etc. In the following year Governor Dungan
of New York revived the route that had been
established by Governor Lovelace, and, in addition, he
proposed post-offices along the Atlantic coast. In 1687
a post was started between certain points in Connecticut.
The real beginning of postal service in America
seems to date from February 17, 1691, when William
and Mary granted to Thomas Neale authority to conduct
offices for the receipt and despatch of letters.
From that time until 1721 the postal system seems to
have been under the direction of Andrew Hamilton and
his associates. In the latter year John Lloyd was appointed
postmaster-general, to be succeeded in 1730 by
Alexander Spotsward. Head Lynch was postmaster-general
from 1739 to 1743, and Elliott Berger from 1743 to 1753.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In July, 1775, the Continental Congress
established its post-office with Benjamin Franklin as its first
postmaster-general. Mr. Franklin had been appointed
postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737. Samuel Osgood,
of Massachusetts, however, was the first postmaster-general
under the Constitution and Washington's administration.
From Samuel Osgood to Hubert Work there have been forty-five
postmasters-general, that official becoming a member of the
President's cabinet in 1829.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fast Mails of Pioneer Days</i></p>

<p class="indent">Post-riders and stage-coaches were the earliest
means of transporting the mails, to be followed by steamboats,
railway trains, and, in time, by airplanes.</p>

<p class="indent">In considering our modern mailing methods, no
feature of the development of our postal system is more
striking than the improvement that has been made in
methods of mail transportation.</p>

<p class="indent">Up to a few decades ago, pony express riders sped
across the western part of our country, and back, carrying
the "fast mail" of the days when Indians and road-agents
constituted a continual source of annoyance and
danger to stage-coach passengers and drivers, and made
the transportation of valuables extremely hazardous.
The coaches carried baggage, express, and "slow mail,"
as well as passengers, while the "fast mail" was handled
exclusively by pony riders.</p>

<p class="indent">The inimitable Mark Twain has given us a great
word-picture of these pony express riders, from which
we quote the following:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot indent space-above1">
In a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our
necks and watching for the "pony rider"&mdash;the fleet messenger
who sped across the continent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying
letters nineteen hundred miles in eight days! Think of that
for perishable horse and human flesh and blood to do! The
pony rider was usually a little bit of a man, brimful of spirit
and endurance. No matter what time of the day or night his
watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or summer,
raining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his "beat" was
a level straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and
precipices, or whether it led through peaceful regions or regions
that swarmed with hostile Indians, he must be always ready to
leap into the saddle and be off like the wind! There was no
idling time for a pony rider on duty. He rode fifty miles without
stopping, by daylight, moonlight, starlight, or through the
blackness of darkness&mdash;just as it happened. He rode a splendid
horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a gentleman;
kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as
he came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding
fast a fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag
was made in the twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager
pair and they were out of sight before the spectator could get
hardly the ghost of a look. The postage on his literary freight
was worth five dollars a letter. He got but little frivolous
correspondence to carry&mdash;his bag had business letters in it, mostly.
His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight, too. He wore
a little wafer of a racing-saddle, and no visible blanket. He
wore light shoes, or none at all. The little flat mail-pockets
strapped under the rider's thighs would each hold about the bulk
of a child's primer. They held many and many an important
business chapter and newspaper letter, but these were written
on paper as airy and thin as gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk and
weight were economized. The stage-coach travelled about a hundred
to a hundred and twenty-five miles a day (twenty-four
hours), and the pony rider about two hundred and fifty. There
were about eighty pony riders in the saddle all the time, night and
day, stretching in a long scattering procession from Missouri to
California, forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and
among them making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring
livelihood and see a deal of scenery every single day in the year.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot indent">We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning,
to see a pony rider, but somehow or other all that passed us and all
that we met managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard
only a whiz and a hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was
gone before we could get our heads out of the windows. But now
we were expecting one along every moment, and would see him
in broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:</p>

<p style="font-size: 120%; text-align: center;"><b>"HERE HE COMES!"</b></p>

<p class="blockquot indent">Every neck is stretched further, and every eye
strained wider. Away across the endless dead level of the prairie a black
speck appears against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I
should think so. In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider,
rising and falling, rising and falling&mdash;sweeping toward us, nearer
and nearer&mdash;growing more and more distinct, more and more
sharply defined, nearer and still nearer, and the flutter of the
hoofs comes faintly to the ear&mdash;another instant and a whoop and
a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider's hand, but no
reply, and man and horse burst past our excited faces, and go
winging away like a belated fragment of a storm!</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below3">So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal
fancy, that but for the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a
mail-sack after the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we
might have doubted whether we had seen anything at all, maybe.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mail Transportation To-day</i></p>

<p class="indent">Mails are now carried over about 235,000 miles of
railroads. Service on the railroads is authorized and paid
for under a space basis system authorized by Congress
and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The present post-office organization dates from
about 1836, as the period that followed that year was one of
transition from stage-coach to rail car for the transportation
of mails. As railway mail service was increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and extended, sometimes railroad companies
made arrangements with contractors to handle it.
Occasionally contracts were transferred to the contractors
at the same rates received by the railroads.
Frequently the compensation was divided pro rata as
far as the railroad covered the route. It was not uncommon
for postmasters in large cities to make the
arrangements for the department. Naturally such a
lack of uniformity of procedure and control invited
irregularities of one kind or another, although they
were for the most part not serious ones, and were eventually
corrected and a system of standards and of unified
control put into effect.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Origin of Mail Classes</i></p>

<p class="indent">In 1845 any letter that weighed one half ounce
or less was classified as a single letter without regard to the
number of sheets it contained; a five-cent rate was
charged for distances under three miles and ten cents
for greater distances. In 1847 the postage-stamp was
officially adopted and placed on sale July 1 of that year
at New York. In the year 1848, 860,380 postage-stamps
were sold; in 1890, 2,219,737,060 stamps were
sold, and in 1921 there were issued to postmasters
14,000,000,000 adhesive stamps, 1,100,000,000 postal
cards, 2,668,000,000 stamped envelopes, and 80,800,000
newspaper wrappers.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1850 the rates were reduced to three cents
for any distance less than three hundred miles, if prepaid, and
five cents if not prepaid, and, for a greater distance, six
cents if prepaid and ten cents if not prepaid. The prepayment
of postage was finally made compulsory in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
1855. In 1863 a uniform rate of three cents for single
letters not exceeding one half ounce in weight was
adopted for all distances, and twenty years later, in
1883, the two-cent letter was adopted. In 1917 the
rates of three cents on letters and two cents for postal
cards were adopted, the extra cent in each case being
for war revenue. On June 30, 1919, however, the three-cent
letter rate and the two-cent postal-card rate expired
by limitation, and the two-cent letter rate and
one-cent postal-card rate returned.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">When the parcel post was established in
1913, and the air mail service was inaugurated in 1918, special
stamps were issued, although they were soon discontinued.
Our friends who collect stamps may be glad
to know that a philatelic stamp agency has been established
under the third assistant postmaster-general at
Washington, which sells to stamp-collectors at the face-value
all stamps desired which are in stock and which
may have special philatelic value to stamp-collectors.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Emergency Measures During the War</i></p>

<p class="indent">As a war measure, on July 31, 1918, by executive
order issued in accordance with a Joint Resolution of the
House and Senate, the telegraph and telephone systems
of the United States were placed under the control of
the postmaster-general, and on November 2, 1918, the
marine cables were also placed under his control. These
utilities were conducted by a wire control board, of
which the postmaster-general was the head. The
marine cables were returned to their owners May 2,
1919, and the telephone and telegraph lines were returned
to their owners in accordance with an act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Congress on August 1, 1919, having been under government
control just one year.</p>

<p class="indent">When the telegraph was invented, in 1847,
the first line between Washington and Baltimore was built
through an appropriation authorized by Congress.
Then, as now, there were public men who advocated
government ownership of the wire systems as a means
of communication, the same as the postal service. It
was placed in private control, however, one year after
its inauguration, and has grown up under that control.
The Government's operation during the war of both
the wire and railroad systems seems to have cooled
the ardor of even the most enthusiastic advocates of
government ownership of such utilities.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Early in 1919 the Post-office Department
used the wireless telegraph in connection with air mail service.
A central station is located in the Post-office Department
Building at Washington, and other stations are
located in cities near the transcontinental air mail
route from New York City to San Francisco. Experiments
are being made with the wireless as a means of
directing airplanes in flight, especially during foggy
and stormy weather, and it is expected planes will ultimately
be equipped with either wireless telegraph or
telephone outfits. On April 22, 1921, the Post-office
Department adopted the use of the wireless telephone
in addition to the wireless telegraph service, and is now
using both in the air mail service, and also for the purpose
of broadcasting to farming communities governmental
information such as market reports from the
Agricultural Department and the big market centers. It
is not contemplated, however, that the Post-office Department
will maintain the wireless telegraph and telephone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
except as an aid in the development of the air
mail service; only when not in use for this purpose is it
utilized to broadcast the governmental information referred
to for the benefit of farming communities and
without expense to them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Post-office in the War</i></p>

<p class="indent">As may be imagined, the work of the Post-office Department
consequent upon the war was enormous; it
participated in and did war work for practically all
other departments of the Government. Besides the
great increase of ordinary mail as a result of the war, it
assisted in the work of the draft, the Liberty Loans, the
Red Cross service, food, fuel, and labor conservation,
the enforcement of the Alien Enemy and Espionage
laws, and nearly every war activity placed upon it some
share of the burden. The Post-office Department,
whose function is purely civil, with responsibility for
a business service that must not be interrupted, kept
open channels of communication upon which the vital
activities of the Nation depended, and unquestionably
made material contributions toward the successful
prosecution of the war.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The department was of assistance to
the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Intelligence of both the
Army and the Navy; the Department of Labor, in collecting
data relative to firms and classes of labor in the country;
the Department of Agriculture, the Shipping
Board, and various independent bureaus of the Government.
Under proclamation of the President, postmasters
of towns having populations of 5000 or less
had the duty of registering enemy aliens. The department
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
collected all the statistics and lists of aliens for
the Department of Justice. A similar work was performed
with respect to the duties of the Alien Property
Custodian. Nine million questionnaires were distributed
for the War Department, each being handled three
times during the first draft; about thirteen million
questionnaires were distributed in the second draft.
The department distributed literature for the Liberty
Loans and the Red Cross, and assisted in the sale of War
Savings Stamps and Internal Revenue Stamps. New
postal service was established for the soldiers at nearly
a hundred cantonments in this country. When the
American forces went abroad an independent postal
service was established in France by the Post-office
Department which was later turned over to the military
authorities. That the United States postal service was
the only one in the world that did not break down during
the war might well be cause for pardonable pride.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Beginning of Registered Mail, Postal Money-orders,<br />
Savings, Free Delivery, Special Delivery,<br />Parcel Post, and Air Mail</i></p>

<p class="indent">The registry service was established in 1855
and the money-order service was established in 1864. About
$1,500,000,000 is transmitted by money-orders annually.
Postal-savings service was established January
3, 1911, and during the first year the deposits reached a
total of $677,145. The increase in this department has
been continuous each year, and in a recent year the
amount was over $150,000,000. The parcel-post system
was established January 1, 1913, and now nearly
three billion parcels are handled annually.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">In 1863 the innovation of free delivery of mail in
forty-nine cities was undertaken, for which 449 carriers
were employed. In 1890, 454 cities enjoyed free delivery
of mail and 9066 carriers did the work. In 1921
there were about 3000 city delivery post-offices and
about 36,000 carriers. The Post-office Department
owns and operates almost 4000 automobiles in the collection
and delivery of mail in cities, but this is a small
part of the number operating under contract. The regular
use of the automobile in the postal service dates
back only to 1907. The feature of special delivery of
mail was inaugurated in 1885.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The first regular air mail route was
inaugurated May 15, 1918, between Washington and New York, a distance
of about 200 miles, the schedule being two hours,
compared with about five hours for steam trains.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p class="f150 space-below2"><b><i>Airplane mail equipment.</i></b></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">An air route between Cleveland and Chicago
was inaugurated May 15, 1919, and between New York and
Cleveland July 1, 1919. The Transcontinental Air
Mail Route from New York to San Francisco, inaugurated
September 8, 1920, is the only route at present in
operation. This coast-to-coast route is 2629 miles in
length, passing through Cleveland, Chicago, Omaha,
Cheyenne, Salt Lake City, and Reno. Relays of planes
are used, but, contrary to the general impression, mail
is not carried all the way by air; instead, planes pick
up mail which has missed trains and advance it to
points where it will catch through trains.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Three rural routes, the first ones,
were established in 1896 in West Virginia. By 1900 there were 1259;
in 1906, 32,110; 1912, 42,199; on January 1, 1922, there
were 44,007. Rural routes now in operation cover a
total of 1,152,000 miles and the number of patrons
served is about 30,000,000. The Rural Free Delivery
Service brings in but about one fourth of its cost.
There are also about 11,000 contract mail routes (star
routes) serving communities not reached by rail or
rural routes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Postal Business Increases</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the five years from 1912 to 1917, the increase
in the volume of business as reflected by the annual gross receipts
of the post-office was 33.64 per cent., and in the
ten-year period from 1912 to 1921, inclusive, it was
87.84 per cent. During this decade there was a decrease
in postal receipts in but one year as compared with the
previous year, and that was in 1915, when the percentage
of decrease was 0.23 per cent. For the ten years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
mentioned the percentage of increase in receipts for
each year over the previous year was as follows:</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Post-office and Good Roads</i></p>

<p class="indent">The pony express riders, to whom reference has
already been made, rode over trails and cow-paths made by
herds of buffaloes, deer, or cattle. To-day, however, as
part of our post-office appropriations, large sums are
included for construction and keeping in repair public
roads and routes used by different branches of our mail
service. For the present year there was appropriated
for carrying out the provisions of the Federal Highway
Act the sum of $75,000,000 for what is known as
Federal aid to the States in road construction, and
$10,000,000 for forest roads for 1923. A comprehensive
program has been adopted and, in order that the States
may make adequate provisions to meet their share for
the Federal appropriations, they know in advance just
what Federal appropriation they can depend upon.</p>

<p class="indent">The total Federal aid funds which have been
apportioned to the States from 1916 to 1921 amount to
$339,875,000. On February 1, 1922, $213,947,790 had been
paid on actual construction, leaving a balance for new
construction of $125,927,214. Between February 1 and
July 1 of this year about $40,927,000 more was put into construction.

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Washington Headquarters</i></p>

<p class="indent">The main Post-office Department Building is
located at 11th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. What is known as the City Post-Office
Building is at North Capitol Street and Massachusetts
Avenue in that city, and the mail equipment shops are
located at 5th and W Streets, N.E. The total number
of employees in the General Department is 2025.</p>

<p class="indent">The clerks throughout the department, in
character, intelligence, and dependability, are above the average.
Not only must postal clerks be familiar with the location
of several thousand post-offices, but they must know
on what railroad each post-office is located, through
what junction points a letter despatched to that office
must pass, and many other important details. The
schedules of railroads affect the method of despatching
mail, and these are constantly changing so that postal
clerks must be up to the minute on all schedules, etc.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Red Corpuscles for Our Postal Arteries</i></p>

<p class="indent">A new post-office policy that is well expressed
by the words "humanized service" has been inaugurated. The
postal educational exhibits which have been conducted
in many of the larger offices for the purposes of teaching
the public how to mail and how not to mail letters,
parcels, and valuables were but single manifestations
of this new spirit. Some persons may think&mdash;and with
good reason&mdash;that only recently have postal authorities
indicated concern in what the public did; but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the present interest is genuine is evident to any one.
The department is likewise interested in its workers
and makes an effort to understand them. Says the head
of the department in his latest report: "We are dependent
on the nerve and the sense of loyalty of human
beings for the punctual delivery of our mail regardless
of the weather and everything else. To treat a postal
employee as a mere commodity in the labor market is
not only wicked from a humanitarian standpoint, but
is foolish and short-sighted even from the standpoint of
business. The postal employee who is regarded as a
human being whose welfare is important to his fellows,
high and low, in the national postal organization, is
bound to do his work with a courage, a zest, and a
thoroughness which no money value can ever buy. The
security which he feels he passes on to the men and
women he serves. Instead of a distrust of his Government,
he radiates confidence in it. I want to make
every man and woman in the postal service feel that he
or she is a partner in this greatest of all business
undertakings, whose individual judgment is valued, and
whose welfare is of the utmost importance to the successful
operation of the whole organization. We want
every postal co-worker to feel that he has more than a
job. A letter-carrier does a good deal more than bring
a letter into a home when he calls. He ought to know
the interest which his daily travels bring to the home.
We have 326,000 men and women with the same objective,
with the same hopes and aspirations, all working
together for the same purpose, a mutual appreciation
one for the other, serving an appreciative public.
If we can improve the spirit and actual working conditions
of these 326,000 men and women who do this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
job, that in itself is an accomplishment, and it is just
as certain to bring a consequent improvement in the
service as the coming of tomorrow's sun."</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Welfare Work</i></p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Few people know that to-day a welfare
department is in operation throughout the postal system which is
directly interested in improving the working conditions
of all the postal workers. The department was organized
in June, 1921, by the appointment of a welfare
director. Councils of employees meet regularly to consider
matters affecting their welfare and to discuss
plans for improving the postal service. The National
Welfare Council has been formed of the following
postal employee organizations:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5em;">National Federation of Post-office Clerks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The Railway Mail Association</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">United National Association of Post-office Clerks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">National Rural Letter-Carriers Association</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">National Association of Letter-Carriers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">National Federation of Rural Carriers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">National Association of Supervisory Employees</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">National Federation of Federal Employees</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">National Association of Post-office Laborers</span></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">Mutual aid and benefit societies with
insurance features are conducted, athletics are encouraged, sick
benefits are provided, retirement pensions are in effect,
and postal employees to-day can well believe that somebody
cares about their comfort and welfare. Incidentally,
savings aggregating many thousands of dollars
annually have been effected through the suggestions
and inventions of employees in the service.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">One of the important divisions in the postal
service is that which pertains to the inspection work, much
of which does not attract outside attention and only
comes to public notice when some one has gotten into
trouble with the postal authorities. In a large measure,
inspection work pertains to the apprehension of criminals
and the investigation of depredations, but that is
only a comparatively small part of the division's activities.</p>

<p class="indent">Post-office inspectors investigate and report
upon matters affecting every branch of the postal service;
they are traveling auditors and check up accounts and
collect shortages; they decide where an office should be
located, how it should be fitted up, and how many
clerks or carriers may be needed.</p>

<p class="indent">The rural carriers, for instance, must be
familiar with the regulations that cover the delivery of mail,
registration of letters, taking applications for money-orders,
sale of stamps, supplies, etc., but the inspector
must also know all of these and also be able to determine
when the establishment of a route is warranted,
to lay out and fix the schedules and prepare a map and
description of the route, also measure the routes if
the length is in dispute, inspect the service, ascertain
whether it is properly performed, and give necessary
instructions to the carriers and postmasters.</p>

<p class="indent">Carriers must know their districts, understand
regulations covering the delivery of mail, handling of registry,
insurance and collection on delivery matter, collection
of mail and handling of change of address and
forwarding orders. The inspector, however, determines
when conditions are such at an office that city
delivery service may be installed, the number of carriers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
necessary, and the number of deliveries to be
made. He lays out the routes, locates the collection
boxes, and fixes the schedules. He is also called on to
investigate the service when extensions are desired or
when carriers are deemed necessary, and is concerned
with clerks, supervisory officers, postmasters, new post-offices,
railway mail service, contracts for transportation
of mail and furnishing of supplies, as well as the
enforcement of criminal statutes covering train robberies,
post-office burglaries, money-order forgeries,
lottery men, the transmission of obscene literature,
mail-bag thieves, embezzlers, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p class="center space-above1"><i>Early New York</i></p>

<p class="indent">The first ships which arrived after the
settlement of New York as New Amsterdam brought letters, and the
first post-office, such as it was, began to function about
the time the city was founded.</p>

<p class="indent">When vessels arrived, those letters relating
to the cargoes were delivered to merchants; persons who welcomed
the ships received their letters by hand. If a
letter was unclaimed, it was left with a responsible private
citizen until called for.</p>

<p class="indent">In time a system of voluntary distribution
was developed, which became known as the "Coffee House Delivery."
It was naturally popular and continued for
over a century. At first this method of delivery was
used by vessels and by people from distant points who
left their mail for delivery at some well-known tavern.
Here it reposed in a box accessible to all, or it was
tacked to the surface of a smooth board with tape or
brass-headed nails and placed in a conspicuous part of
the tavern.</p>

<p class="indent">In the year 1710 the postmaster-general of Great
Britain designated a "chief letter office" in the City of
New York, Philadelphia having been the headquarters
of the Colonial organization up to that time. In the
following year arrangements were completed for the
delivery of Boston mail twice a month, and a foot-post
to Albany was proposed.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1740 a complete road was blazed from Paulus
Hook, Jersey City, to Philadelphia, over which the mail
was carried on horseback between Philadelphia and New York.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Alexander Colden was postmaster here at the time
of the Revolution, but when the British troops took
possession of New York, the office was abolished by the
provost-marshal and for seven years little correspondence
not connected with the movement of troops was
handled.</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">William Bedloe, after whom Bedloe's
Island was named, was the first postmaster after the war, but in
1786 Sebastian Bauman succeeded him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The New York General Post-office To-day</i></p>

<p class="indent">The world's greatest post-office to-day is the New York
General Post-office, located at Eighth Avenue and
West 33d Street, but a short block from the West Side
Office of the Manufacturers Trust Company, and we
are glad to be able to include in this booklet a message
to our readers from Hon. E. M. Morgan, Postmaster,
who directs the activities of that great organization.</p>

<p class="indent">The growth of business transacted by the New York
post-office is illustrated by the following statement showing the
postal revenues for the years mentioned. It appears that the first
account of revenues of the New York post-office was published
in the year 1786, and the first city directory was also published
in that year, and contained 926 names.</p>

<p class="indent">According to a recent statement by Hon. Hubert Work,
Postmaster-General, the postal business now done in New York City alone
is equivalent to that of the United States twenty-five years ago, and
is double that of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p class="indent">During my personal experience with the postal affairs
of this great city, the service has been expanded from a post-office with
eleven stations and 973 employees to an enormous establishment
having a total of 362 stations, including fifty carrier and financial
stations, 271 contract stations, and forty-one United States Warship
Branches; requiring a total force of 15,600 post-office employees.
The postmaster at New York is also the Central
Accounting Postmaster for 1375 district post-offices (365 third-class
and 1010 fourth-class post-offices) located in thirty-five
counties of New York State.</p>

<p class="indent">The transactions of this important office are constantly
increasing in volume as a result of the great expansion and growth of
New York City, which is greatly influenced by the progress and
growth of the entire country. New York City, as the metropolis
of the United States, is taking her place at the head of the large
cities of the world in population, finance, and commercial affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">If the progress made in the past fifty years by the United States
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and its possessions in the conduct of national and international
business continues, the postal business here will, no doubt, make
tremendous strides.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of another fifty years, or in the year 1972,
the postmaster at New York will be the head of a much greater
establishment than the present office, which will be comparable
to that organization of the future as the first post-office in New
York City, located in the "Coffee House," Coenties Slip, in 1642,
is comparable to the present post-office. The future postmaster
of New York, in 1972, will probably be the head of a number of
consolidated post-offices in the metropolitan area, and, no doubt,
other public services will be placed under his supervision.</p>

<p class="indent">The further development and improvement of the a√´roplane
mail service will no doubt result in a greater use of that facility
for the transportation of mails. The transportation of the mails
through the streets of New York is a great problem. At present
motor trucks are principally used for that purpose. It is
anticipated that even with this service augmented by the
re-establishment of the pneumatic tubes, future extensions to the
underground method of transportation will be necessary. It is
likely that before many years are passed a system of tunnels
for the transportation of mails in pouches and sacks will be built
and placed in operation.</p>

<p class="indent">Congress and the Post-office Department are now looking
into the matter of providing the post-office at New York with a large
amount of additional room in new buildings specially constructed
for post-office purposes and it is the constant aim and purpose
of all concerned in the operation of the New York post-office to
furnish its patrons the best postal service.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The New York Post-office</i></p>

<p class="indent">Conceive, if you can, an organization that is
incessantly and perpetually going at top speed; that knows not a
moment of rest the year round, or generation after
generation; which never sleeps, nor pauses, nor hesitates;
that disposes each day of a mountain of
14,300,000 pieces of ordinary mail, or more than any
other office in the world; that does a parcel-post business
that makes the business of the express companies
seem small in comparison; that handles in excess of
41,500,000 pieces of registered mail each year; that
issues nearly four million money-orders annually, and
pays over seventeen million more; that, as a mere
side issue does a banking business which is exceeded
by but a few banks in the whole State; that has in its
safe custody the savings of approximately 140,000
depositors, amounting to more than $44,000,000; that
employs an army of 15,000 men and women; that occupies
one of the largest buildings in the city, two
blocks in length, and then overflows into approximately
fifty annexes, called "Classified Stations," and nearly
200 sub-annexes, called "Contract Stations"; that has
receipts in excess of $52,000,000 per annum; that has
doubled its business in ten years. Having conceived
this, you will begin to get some idea of the New York
post-office, the biggest thing of its kind in the world
and still growing.</p>

<p class="indent">The average man's conception of a post-office
includes little more than an impression of a letter-carrier
in a gray uniform; a mail wagon recently dodged by a
narrow margin; a post-office station somewhere in his
neighborhood, and a hazy picture of a dingy place in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
which men sometimes post letters. Of the details of
the organization aside from these things, the extent and
complexities of the service, or how it accomplishes what
it does, or of the executive experts operating the system,
he knows practically nothing. He is aware, it is
true, that letters are collected and that letters are delivered,
and that continents and oceans may divide the
sender and addressee; but by what mystic methods
delivery is accomplished he has never stopped to think.
Yet the organization that lies behind the words "New
York post-office" is one of the most complex, efficient,
and interesting in the world, and yet it operates with
a simplicity and a smoothness that betoken master
design and perfection of detail.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Postmaster</i></p>

<p class="indent">At the head of this great organization and
directing its every movement, watching its development, adjusting
its activities, is one of the most experienced and
efficient postal experts in America, in the person of
Postmaster Edward M. Morgan, whose interesting
statement is included at the head of this section.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Morgan entered the postal service in 1873
as a letter-carrier, at the foot of the ladder, and by an
industry that was tireless and force of character he
worked his way up, round after round, to the very top.
In the course of his long public service he transferred
from the carrier force to the clerical force, and then
graduated from this to the supervisory ranks, discharging
each successive grade with conspicuous ability. His
several titles in the course of this career were: carrier,
clerk, chief clerk, superintendent of stations, superintendant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of delivery, assistant postmaster, acting postmaster,
postmaster. He was first appointed postmaster
by President Roosevelt, and reappointed by President
Taft. For an interval during President Wilson's administration
he was out of office, but was reappointed
by President Harding. With such a record of progress
and experience it is very evident that he must "know
the game," but if one knows nothing of his history, and
meets him for a few minutes, his grasp of detail and
vision of opportunity for future development become
at once apparent.</p>

<p class="indent">Postmaster Morgan has gathered around him
as his heads of divisions a corps of enthusiastic aides who
have grown up in the service under his tutelage, and
each of whom has advanced step by step under the
keenest competition, demonstrating his competency
for the position he fills by the satisfactory manner in
which he has discharged the duties of the position of
lower rank. Among his aides there are no amateurs;
all have been tried for a generation or more in positions
of varying and increasing importance, and they have
stood the test; they are recognized the country over as
postal experts, and the work they are doing and the
efficiency they are showing are proof that their reputations
are well merited.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Organisation of the New York Post-office</i></p>

<p class="indent">Next in rank to the postmaster are the assistant postmaster
and the acting assistant postmaster, the first at
the head of the financial divisions and miscellaneous
executive departments, and the second at the head of
various divisions engaged in handling the mails proper.

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Assistant Postmaster</i></p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The assistant postmaster is Mr. John J. Kiely,
who has been in the service thirty-seven years, and, like the
postmaster, has worked up from the ranks, advancing
through the various grades as foreman, assistant superintendent,
superintendent, division head, etc., to the
title he now holds. For a number of years he was in
charge first of one and then of another of the great terminal
stations of the city, where the greatest volumes
of mail are handled of any of the stations in this country,
and later was made superintendent of mails, from
which position he was recently promoted to the title he now holds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
  <img src="images/plaque.png" alt="Plaque" width="500" height="291" />
</div>
<p class="f120"><i>A new kind of sign in Government offices.</i></p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Acting Assistant Postmaster</i></p>

<p class="indent">The acting assistant postmaster is Mr. Thomas B.
Randles, who is responsible for the movement of the
mails, and who, for several years prior to his attaining
his present rank, was assistant superintendent of mails;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
prior to that, he was superintendent of different stations
in various parts of the city. He has seen twenty-eight
years' service in various ranks.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Division Heads</i></p>

<p class="indent">Next in rank to the officials mentioned there
is a group of division heads, corresponding with the various major
activities of the office, including the Division of Delivery,
the Division of Mails, the Division of Registered
Mails, and the Division of Money-Orders, followed by
the cashier, the auditor, the classification division, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">The duties of each of these heads are very clearly
defined by Postmaster Morgan, and each head is held to
strict responsibility for the faithful and efficient conduct
of his division or department. The postmaster
himself is ever ready to give advice and counsel, and is
the most accessible of executives, not only to his staff,
but to employees of all rank and to the public. He in
turn requires of all of his aides not only a thorough
knowledge of every detail of their work, but also that
they shall be as accessible to those under them and to
the public as he is himself.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Postmaster's Weekly Conference</i></p>

<p class="indent">Once each week the postmaster meets his division
heads and department chiefs in formal council, when
the problems of the service are freely discussed and
plans are formulated for such undertakings as may
require unity of action and co√∂perative effort. These
conferences keep the various heads apprised of what is
of importance in the various departments, and promote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
an esprit de corps and co√∂perative attitude that
explain the exceptional unity of effort that is characteristic
of the entire organization. One has only to
study the organization for a short time to discover that
one of its strongest features is the manifest team-work,
the one animating and controlling influence throughout
it all being "the interest of the service."</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Delivery Division</i></p>

<p class="indent">Closest to the heart of the public of all the
postal employees&mdash;probably because they see so many of them
and know so much of their faithful work as they plod
along day in and day out, in all kinds of weather, with
their heavy loads weighing down their shoulders and
twisting their spines&mdash;are the letter-carriers. These are
all under the Division of Delivery, the superintendent
of which is Mr. Charles Lubin. Mr. Lubin entered the
service in 1890, as a substitute clerk, and is another
example of the executive who has risen, step by step,
through all the various clerical grades to supervisory
rank, and then through the various supervisory ranks
to his present title. The Delivery Division includes in
its personnel, in addition to 2954 letter-carriers, 3621
clerks, 282 laborers, and 1800 substitute employees, so
that it constitutes a small army in itself.</p>

<p class="indent">The New York post-office covers both Manhattan
and the Bronx, with a postal population which greatly
exceeds the population as shown by the census. To
New York gravitate daily hundreds of thousands of
people who are employed in Manhattan and the Bronx
but who reside in Brooklyn, New Jersey, Long Island,
or elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of others reside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
at one address in Manhattan or the Bronx, but do business
at another, receiving mail at both addresses. Including
these, the transients, and the commuters mentioned,
it is estimated that the Delivery Division is
receiving mail for approximately 8,000,000 addressees
in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx.</p>

<p class="indent">Adequately to meet the requirements of this
vast number there are scheduled, for the business section of
the city, six carrier deliveries daily, and four for the
residential sections. Just what this means will be
better appreciated if one will pause and try to visualize
what it means to traverse every street and alley of the
great area covered by Manhattan and the Bronx from
four to six times daily, stopping at every door for which
there is mail, and effecting delivery in apartments, in
tenements, in office buildings, and in factories.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the 2954 carriers mentioned above, 384 are
employed in collecting mail from the street boxes, both
package and letter, and from the chutes in office buildings,
etc. From the boxes in remote suburban districts
three to five collections are made daily, from boxes in
the residential sections from seven to fifteen collections
daily, while in the business sections the collections run
from fifteen to twenty-seven.</p>

<p class="indent">Even with the frequency of collection that
takes place in the intensively developed business sections,
the boxes fill up as quickly as they are emptied.</p>

<p class="indent">To appreciate how quickly, and to make clear
the volume of mail collected by the carriers, it may be
stated that among the office buildings equipped with
chute letter-boxes are the Equitable Life, thirty-nine
stories, and the Woolworth, fifty-five stories, from each
of which fifty-five to sixty full sacks of mail are collected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
by the carriers daily between 3 and 7.30 P.M.
These sacks are conveyed by wagons to the Varick
Street Station for postmarking and despatch, four carriers
being engaged on the task.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The volume of mail collected at the close
of business in the lower part of the city, and largely from buildings
equipped with chutes and boxes, exceeds that handled
by many first-class post-offices for an entire twenty-four-hour period.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
  <img src="images/illus-046.jpg" alt="Rear view of NYGPO" width="600" height="363" />
</div>
<p class="f110">

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Side offices, nearby (in semi-circle).</i></span></p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Stations</i></p>

<p class="indent">For greater efficiency in handling the mails,
to shorten the trips of carriers and collectors and to serve the
public convenience, as the city has grown, various
classified or carrier stations have been established, and
of these there are now no fewer than forty-eight in
operation and also two financial stations. The classified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
or carrier stations are practically complete post-offices,
so far as the public is concerned, affording full
facilities for the sale of stamps, money-orders, postal
savings, registration of mail, acceptance of parcel post,
the distribution of mail, etc., and for the delivery and
collection of mail by carriers. The financial stations
afford all the conveniences mentioned for the benefit
of the public, except that they do not make delivery of
mail nor effect its distribution.</p>

<p class="indent">It is estimated that the delivery division effects
the delivery daily through the carriers assigned to the general
office and to the various stations of approximately
5,000,000 letters, cards, and circulars, 800,000 papers,
periodicals, and pieces of printed matter and small
parcel-post packages, and 65,000 bulky parcel-post
packages, or, in all, close to 6,000,000 pieces of mail of
all classes.</p>

<p class="indent">But the delivery of mail is only part of the story,
for it is estimated that the public mail daily in the various
chutes, classified station "drops," and street letter
boxes, etc., approximate 5,000,000 pieces of first-class
mail and several million circulars, all of which have to
be gathered together and put through the various processes
of cancellation, sorting, etc., before the actual
work of delivery or despatch begins.</p>

<p class="indent">The tremendous magnitude of the business
of the various stations is shown not only in the volume of
mail received and delivered, but in the sale of stamps,
the collection of postage on second-class matter, etc.,
constituting the receipts.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The receipts at the City Hall Station, for
instance, are greater than the receipts of any post-office in
the United States except Chicago, Ill., Philadelphia, Pa.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and Boston, Mass., as shown by the table below, giving
figures for the fiscal year 1921. In the case of all the
offices named, the figures include not only the main
office but all the stations of the offices. In the case
of the City Hall Station alone, the figures are for this
unit exclusively, and no other point.</p>

as great as the receipts of Detroit, Mich., and

<p class="indent space-above1">In addition to the actual receipts
of the various stations, made up by the sale of stamps, etc., as
described, their financial transactions incident to the money-order
and postal-savings business are tremendous, as will
later be shown in detail under the heading "Division of
Money-Orders" and "Postal Savings"; suffice it to say
here that the City Hall Station issued last year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
money-orders to the value of $3,183,209, and the Madison
Square Station money-orders to the value of $2,004,273,
while Station "B" had to the credit of its postal-savings
depositors $6,786,622, Tompkins Square Station,
$5,580,389, and Station "U," $4,595,974.</p>

<p class="indent">How greatly the business of the stations has
grown is evidenced by the fact that in 1875 the gross receipts
for the year amounted to but $3,166,946.19, which is
less than the receipts for one month at the present time,
the receipts for last July amounting to $3,821,095.94.</p>

<p class="indent">To those who are now enjoying the advantage of
free delivery service it seems that it is the natural thing, and
it is difficult for them to realize how a busy community
could get along without it, yet as a matter of fact it
was not established until 1863, when it was experimentally
installed in forty-nine cities, with but 449
carriers, which number is about a seventh of those employed
at the present time in New York alone.</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">The number of stations has also increased
rapidly. In 1889 there were but eighteen classified stations and
twenty contract stations in New York, while to-day, as
previously mentioned, there are forty-eight of the
former, two financial, and 271 contract stations authorized,
and also forty-one Warship Branches.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Foreign Mail for City Delivery</i></p>

<p class="indent">The receipts of foreign mail from Europe is increasing
very rapidly. During the month of July, 1922, there
was received for delivery in New York City from foreign
countries 3,372,767 letters and 2577 sacks of foreign papers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

New York General Post Office building notice its<br />
architectural beauty of design and perspective.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The task of handling the city mail received from
steamers is particularly trying, since many of the addresses
are difficult to read, insufficient postage is prepaid
in many cases, and it comes not in a steady flow
but in quantities at one time; and it is, of course, always
in addition to the regular daily quota of domestic
matter. In exemplification of this it may be said that
on August 11, 1922, a single steamer, the <i>Mauretania</i>,
brought in 8553 sacks of letters.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Division of Mails</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Division of Mails embraces the Division
of Delivery, which has already been described, the great terminal
stations, that is, the Grand Central Station (including
the Foreign Station Annex); also the Division
of Registered Mails and the Motor Vehicle Service.
All of these, as previously mentioned, are under the
general supervision of Acting Assistant Postmaster
Randles. The Division of Mails proper, exclusive of
the Division of Delivery and of the Division of Registered
Mails, is under the acting superintendent of mails,
Mr. Peter A. McGurty. Mr. McGurty was formerly
assistant superintendent of delivery, and has been
in the postal service in New York since 1897. Mr.
McGurty, like other division heads, served first as a
clerk, and rose gradually, grade by grade, to his present
position. In the Mailing Division there are 4942
employees. The duties of the Mailing Division are
many and varied. In the main it is responsible for the
distribution and despatch of all outgoing mail, including
the parcel post. It is in itself a complex organization,
employing not only the army of men above mentioned
but an enormous fleet of motor vehicles and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
complex mechanical equipment for the conveyance of
mail from one part of an office to another, and the loading
of it upon railroad cars, ships, etc. The average
daily transactions of the division are as follows:</p>

<table border="0" style="max-width: 40em;" cellspacing="0" summary="_" cellpadding="0" >

      <td class="tdr">$&nbsp;2,500</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="indent space-above1">One duty of the Mailing Division is
the weighing of second-and third-class matter to determine the postage
required thereon. The daily average of the matter
thus weighed is approximately 343,000 pounds, and on
this postage is collected to the amount of approximately $10,500.</p>

<p class="indent">In order to make clear what is involved in the
handling of a great volume of mail such as is disposed of
daily in this division of the New York office, it may be
well to describe the course that is followed by a single
letter. Assume that a letter is mailed in a street letterbox,
in the district of a great terminal; it is brought in
by a collector, who deposits it upon a long table surrounded
by many employees. The table is likely to
be what is known as a "pick-up table," which is one
equipped with conveyor belts and convenient slide
apertures for letters of different lengths, and into these
apertures, with nimble fingers, the clerks grouped
around it separate the mass of letters received, placing
the letters with all the stamps in one direction. As
quickly as they do so, the conveyor belts carry the letters,
according to the different sizes into which they
have been separated, to the electrically-driven canceling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
machines. These canceling machines are operated
by a second group of employees, who feed in the letters,
which are canceled at the rate of approximately 25,000
letters per hour. The whirling dies by which are imprinted
the postmarks which cancel the stamps revolve
at almost lightning speed. These postmarks are
changed each half-hour, and the aim is to postmark
the letters as rapidly as they come to hand, so that but
a few minutes intervene between the time of mailing
and time of postmark. This postmark is, in fact, the
pace-maker. Once it is imprinted upon a letter, it can
be determined by the postmark at any time just how
long a time has been required for it to reach a particular
point in the progress toward despatch.</p>

<p class="indent">From the postmarking machine the letters are
carried, sometimes by conveyors, sometimes by hand, and
sometimes by small trucks, to what are known as the
"primary separating cases." These cases are manned
by employees who separate the letters into groups, according
to certain divisions which facilitate the secondary
and further distributions. Thus at the primary
cases the letters are likely to be broken up into lots for
the city delivery, for many different States, for foreign
countries, and for certain large cities. Each separation
on the primary case will likely be followed by a secondary
separation almost immediately. A sufficient
number of men is kept on the facing or pick-up tables,
on the primary cases, and on the secondary cases and
pouching racks, to maintain a continuous movement
of the mails. The aim is to keep the mail moving not
only continuously from the point of posting to the
point of delivery, as nearly in a direct line as practicable,
but rapidly also, and with only an arresting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the movement when this is made necessary by awaiting
the departure of the next train.</p>

<p class="indent">From the secondary cases the letters are carried
to the pouching rack. By the time they reach the pouching
rack they are made up into bundles, various letters
for the same localities having been segregated and tied
together. In some instances the packages of letters are
tagged or labeled for States, in others for cities, and
still others for railroad lines or for sections of such
lines.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The handling of papers and circulars
is much the same, so far as distribution is concerned, as the
handling of letters, though there is considerable variation
as to the details of segregation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
  <img src="images/illus-055.jpg" alt="mail sorting" width="600" height="481" />
</div>
<p class="f110"><i>Carriers sorting mail in the General Post Office.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">With this distribution of the mails
there goes a system of despatches. In respect to these it may be
said that it is essential that various clerks engaged in the
process as described shall know the time of departure
of the many trains leaving New York for different
points. They must know how much time in advance
of departure is essential between "tying out" the packages
of letters and the actual departure of the train
from the station, and thereby allow sufficient time, but
no more time than is absolutely necessary, to make the
connection. Every detail of the work is plotted; nothing
is left to chance. At a certain hour and at a certain
minute every clerk engaged in the same distribution
at the same station ties out for the same office or route,
and likewise at the pouching rack the pouches are
closed, locked, and despatched according to a fixed
schedule. If the pouch has to be carried from the rack
to the truck a given number of feet, a time allowance
is made. At a set time the truck that conveys the
pouches to the station whence the train is to depart
must leave. The time for the vehicle to traverse the
prescribed route is fixed; sufficient time for this <i>and not
more</i> is allowed. Also the time for unloading the truck
and loading the train is fixed. When it is understood
that this course has to be followed by every one of the
millions of letters handled, and that there are 50,000
offices in the United States to which mail is forwarded,
and that in addition to this it is being distributed for
practically every city, town, and hamlet in the world,
the complexity of the task becomes apparent. From
the General Post-office alone there are as many as 457
despatches of first-class mail daily, and forty-five despatches
of second-, third-, and fourth-class matter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Within the last few years the burden of the
parcel post has been added to the duties of the post-office.
It is estimated that 75,000 pieces of parcel-post matter are
handled at the General Post-office daily, and that
65,000 additional pieces of this matter are received at
the same point from the stations.</p>

<p class="indent">Parcel-post packages are commonly very bulky.
Such may now be mailed for local delivery and for
delivery in the first, second, and third zones, that is,
within three hundred miles of the place of mailing, if
they do not exceed seventy pounds in weight, while
packages not in excess of fifty pounds may be mailed
to any address in the United States. The handling of
these packages necessitates the use of entirely different
character of equipment. As far as it is practicable to
do so, this matter is segregated from mail of the other
classes. Many of the packages are too large to be inclosed
readily in mail sacks, and are forwarded "outside."
In the distribution of parcel-post matter, sack
racks are used into which all parcels which are small
enough to be sacked are separated. The distribution,
as in the other classes, is made at primary and secondary racks.</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">A feature of the Mailing Division is
the handling of such equipment, as pouches, sacks, etc., intended
to be used for the transportation of the mails. Approximately
69,000 sacks and 18,000 pouches are shipped by the New York General office daily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Mailing Division&mdash;Incoming Foreign Section</i></p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In this section mails are handled which
are received from foreign countries. These arrive chiefly on steamers
that make New York their port of destination.
Some of the foreign mails, however, reach New York
via Boston, Philadelphia, Key West, New Orleans,
Laredo, San Francisco, Seattle, and Vancouver. The
number of pieces of mail received from foreign countries
weekly by this section approximates 3,639,000
letters and cards, 2,631,000 pieces of printed matter,
15,000 packages of parcel post, and 568,500 registered
articles. These are forwarded to their destination after
distribution. Many of the letters and cards are not
prepaid, or are prepaid but partly, and the postage
charged on such matter approximates $14,200 each week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Owing to the unsettled conditions in
Europe the rates> of postage in foreign countries are continually
changing. As a result of the depreciation of Russian currency,
letters coming from that country have recently
been prepaid at the rate of 450,000 rubles per ounce or
fraction thereof. Prior to the war a ruble was worth
approximately 51.46 cents. The 450,000 rubles are
now equivalent to fifty centimes of gold, or ten cents
in United States currency.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

</div>
<p class="f110"><i>Mail at the Post Office ready to be<br />loaded onto trucks.</i></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">Many peculiarities are noted in the
addresses of incoming foreign letters. Very frequently a letter will
bear upon the envelop a copy of a business letter-head
or bill-head. This is accounted for by the fact that
some one in this country when writing to Europe will
direct his correspondent to address the expected answer
according to the address on the letter-head or bill-head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
he uses, and the foreigner, not knowing what to select
from whatever is printed, takes what he regards to be
the safe course and copies all. A letter will sometimes
be found to bear a full list of everything sold in a country
store, including hardware, provisions, clothing,
shoes, and periodicals and newspapers. In other cases
the senders cut short the addresses and are satisfied if,
in addition to their correspondent's name, they give
"America" spelled in any way that suits them best, and
the ways are legion.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Mailing Division</i>&mdash;<i>Motor Vehicle Service</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Motor Vehicle Service of the New York
post-office is in charge of Mr. William M. Taggart. The fleet
consists of 329 vehicles. All these are owned by the
Government. The Government likewise makes its own
repairs, employs its own chauffeurs and mechanics,
painters, upholsterers, and various artisans incidental
to the operation, repair, and maintenance of the vehicles.
There are two garages, and in all 727 men are
employed. The garages include fully equipped machine-shops,
and stock-rooms in which are constantly
kept duplicate parts for all the machines in use.</p>

<p class="indent">The magnitude of the service will be realized
when it is known that during the last fiscal year the vehicles
traveled 4,330,102 miles, or 174 times the distance
around the world.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">During the last fiscal year the motor vehicle
service made 646,967 trips, according to predetermined schedules,
and 67,053 trips which were not scheduled but of
an emergency character. This gave a total of 713,020
trips. Of this vast number of trips, scheduled and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
emergency, there were but 747 which were but partly
performed and but 1323 which failed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
  <img src="images/illus-061.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="462" />
</div>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;"><i>Mail trucks loaded with parcel post matter to be<br />transported to different stations in the city.</i></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">These trucks are maintained in a
condition for operation at all hours of the day and night. No
matter what weather conditions prevail, the mails must be moved,
and the motor vehicles must be maintained in a condition
of efficient repair to permit of their utilization in
this work. Every detail of expenditure for the fleet is
maintained on a strictly scientific cost accounting basis,
the number of gallons of oil, the service of the tires, the
cost of operation per mile, with and without chauffeur,
are all a matter of record. The repairs made on each
machine are carefully recorded, with the cost for the
parts and the cost of the mechanical help figured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
separately, so that it is ascertainable from the records
what was spent under this heading for each vehicle during
each month and year.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Mailing Division</i>&mdash;<i>Transportation Section</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Transportation Section, under Assistant
Superintendent of Mails John J. McKelvey, is closely co√∂rdinated
with the motor vehicle section. The duty of this
section is to effect the loading of the vehicles and to
arrange the schedules so as effectively to move the mails
from the point at which they are made up to their
despatch by train, or delivery to some station or group
of stations. How great is the volume of mail handled
will be understood when it is said that from the General
Post-office alone the average number of pouches
received and despatched daily is approximately 16,000,
while the average number of sacks received and despatched
is approximately 80,000. The pouches contain
first-class mail and the sacks contain mail of other
classes. The average number of pieces received and
despatched daily, too large to be inserted in either sacks
or pouches, is approximately 15,000. At each of the
great terminals there are very extensive platforms;
the one at the City Hall Station is a block long; that at
the General Post-office two blocks long, and these platforms
are under the control of the transportation department.
During the hours when the mails are being
despatched they are among the busiest spots in the
postal system. As many as 1200 trucks commonly
receive and discharge mail from the General Post-office
platform daily. Other platforms are correspondingly busy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Pneumatic Tubes</i></p>

<p class="indent">The pneumatic tube service has now been resumed
between the General Post-office, the terminals, and certain
of the principal stations of the New York postal
system, which was discontinued June 30, 1918, owing to
the antagonism to this method of transportation on the
part of the then postmaster-general, Mr. Albert
Burleson. Legislation has been enacted and departmental
action taken within the last year to bring about
the resumption of operation of this valuable system.
The pneumatic tubes form what is practically a great
loop running north in two branches from the City Hall.
One branch goes up the east side of the city, east of Central
Park, and the other up the west side, west of Central
Park, the two lines being joined together at 125th
Street by a line running east and west. This loop and
its extensions link the General Post-office and the
following named stations: <b>A, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,
N, O, P, U, V, W, Y</b>, Grand Central, Madison Square,
Times Square, Wall Street, City Hall, and Varick
Street. The City Hall Station is also connected
with the Brooklyn General Post-office. The pneumatic
tubes are located four to six feet below the surface of
the city's streets, and through these tubes cylindrical
steel containers are forced by compressed air. The containers
are approximately seven inches in diameter and
twenty-one inches long, and the pressure of air is sufficient
to impel them at the rate of about thirty miles per
hour. Containers carry from 500 to 700 letters each,
and can be despatched as frequently as one every eight
or ten seconds. It will be seen, therefore, that by means
of the pneumatic tubes a practically continuous flow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the mails can be maintained between stations. The
pneumatic tubes are not owned by the Government, but
the service is leased on a yearly rental basis. Under
the terms of the lease the company that owns the tube
system operates it, and the Government delivers to
the despatching points within the different stations
and terminals the mail to be transported. Upon arrival
at its destination the mail is again delivered to the
postal employees, who are ready to receive it.</p>

<p class="indent">There are approximately twenty-eight miles of
double tubes, so that mail can be despatched in both directions
at the same time. During the period the system
was in operation before the tubes conveyed the mails
with remarkable efficiency, and it is said that as to stoppages
and breakdowns, etc., their operation was 99.79
per cent. perfect. In one day 27,243 containers were
despatched through the tubes, with a total capacity of
more than 10,000,000 letters. They averaged for a
year, though not used to maximum capacity, 5,000,000
letters a day. One advantage of the pneumatic tubes is
their freedom from interruption by inclement weather.
As the tubes are below the surface of the street, conditions
of ice, snow, and sleet, which are embarrassing to
motor vehicles, do not interrupt operation. At different
times in several of our cities vehicles conveying the
mails have been "held up," but with the tubes, robbery
is practically impossible. It is anticipated that
with the tube system resumed a large percentage of
the letter mail intended both for city delivery and for
despatch to other points will be materially advanced in
delivery.</p>

<p class="indent">The Foreign Station of the New York post-office
stands out among the postal activities of the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
for it is the station at which are made up all the mails intended
for foreign countries, with few exceptions, such
as Canada. The superintendent of the station is Mr.
Thomas J. Walters, who has been connected with it
for many years. It is a busy place, particularly just
before the departure of a steamer, when every effort is
exerted to despatch all mail that can be crowded in, up
to the very last minute. This station has grown in a
comparatively short time and from a very small beginning.
In 1885 the average weekly number of sacks
made up for all parts of the world was only 1200; by
1890 the number had grown to 1900; by 1900 it had
reached about 4500; in 1910 the figures were 10,000,
and at the present time the average is approximately
18,000 sacks weekly. Mail is forwarded to the Foreign
Station from all parts of the United States, and is here
distributed for the various foreign countries and cities
for which it is intended. In this distribution expert
knowledge of foreign geography and political divisions
is required, for a large percentage of the mail received
is indefinitely directed, and only an expert could determine
for what points much of it is intended. The shifting
map of Europe has added greatly to the difficulties,
for many correspondents in this country are still
ignorant of the new boundaries.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In the equipment of this station are
hundreds of distribution cases, and many of the letters which the
experts at these cases rapidly sort are actually so
poorly written that the average man would not be
able to decipher them without much study.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p class="space-above1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">One interesting feature of the Foreign Station
is the parcel-post section. The United States now has parcel-post
conventions with many foreign countries, and the
volume of this business is growing very rapidly. The
rate of postage is but twelve cents a pound, and for this
small fee a package will be accepted, even in distant
California or Oregon, transmitted across the continent,
over the ocean, and to a destination in South
America, Europe, or elsewhere. In the early days of
the parcel-post it was used chiefly by the person who
had friends or relatives in Europe and wished to send
a present to them, but it is now being used very extensively
in commercial transactions. By this means
goods ordered from abroad are forwarded by the great
mail-order houses, and the total volume of this business
is large.</p>

<p class="indent">Much difficulty is experienced in inducing
senders of mail matter to wrap it securely. A long campaign
of education has been conducted, but there is still room
for improvement, as evidenced by the fact that four
clerks are engaged repacking, rewrapping, and repairing
packages not properly and safely wrapped, and
supplying addresses in the case of indefinite directions, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">With the increase in the volume of the mail
there has been an increase in the number of ships carrying
the mails, and so, while in August, 1873, there were but
thirty-four vessels carrying mail that sailed from New
York, during July, 1922, 180 such vessels sailed; on a
single day twenty ships left this port carrying a total of
11,299 sacks. During the month of July, 1922, 97,000
sacks of mail were shipped, a quantity that would tax
the capacity of a large warehouse.</p>

<p class="indent">A special feature of the service is the operation
of post-offices on U. S. naval vessels. There are more
than fifty such post-offices, serving the convenience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of the boys in blue. Whether the naval vessels are
equipped with post-offices or not, the Foreign Station
is kept posted as to their movements by the Navy Department,
and special efforts are made to so forward
all mail received as to reach the addressee at the first
port of call.</p>

<p class="indent">During the war the Foreign Station experienced
many trying times in its efforts to get American mail
to destination. The sailing time of ships was seldom
known much in advance of actual sailing, and the
utmost secrecy was maintained as to vessel movements.
The Navy Department advised the Foreign
Station of the intended sailing of vessels by cipher,
though such information was most jealously guarded.
The utmost caution was taken in the making out of
address tags, etc., to conceal the identity of the various
units, the mail for which had to go out by the different
ships, and throughout the war there was not a
single leak. The service performed during this trying
time by the employees of the Foreign Station were so
conspicuously efficient as repeatedly to win approbation.</p>

<p class="indent">A recapitulation of the several classes of mail
despatched from this station to foreign countries is shown
below and indicates the rapidity of its growth:</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Registry Department</i></p>

<p class="indent">One of the most important departments of
the New York post-office is the Registry Division, which is
under the supervision of Mr. Joseph Willon. Mr.
Willon has been long in the postal service, and for
many years prior to his present assignment was superintendent
of some of the larger stations of the city,
including the one at Times Square.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Registry Division at the General
Post-office 550 persons are employed; at the City Hall Station,
130; and at the Foreign Station there is a large force,
assigned exclusively to the handling of the foreign
registered mails.</p>

<p class="indent">The registered mails are the most important
and the most valuable. Just how valuable they are no one
knows, but millions of dollars in cash and securities
are handled daily, and the banks as well as other financial
and commercial interests of the country would be
seriously affected if the registry system ceased to operate,
even for a brief period. Some idea as to the
enormous values handled by the registry department
may be gained from the fact that during the last fiscal
year 7546 packages containing diamonds only were
received from abroad, the dutiable value of which
approximated $150,000,000. In all, 73,000 packages
were received that were regarded as dutiable. Notwithstanding
the enormous values handled, the percentage
of losses is exceedingly small.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the last report of the postmaster-general,
throughout the United States the number of registered
pieces amounted to 78,205,014. The New York post-office
handled 41,592,423, or more than half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of the total. As stated, the percentage of losses is
small, and in the case of first-class registered matter
of domestic origin there is an indemnity up to fifty
dollars, and for the matter of the third class an indemnity
up to twenty-five dollars. Under the agreements
that prevail with certain foreign countries
provision is also made for indemnifying the owners
under certain circumstances where foreign losses occur.</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">The handling of registered mail differs
chiefly from the handling of ordinary mail in the extra care which
is taken to safe-guard it. The aim is to record it
at the time of receipt, and to thereafter require all
persons handling it to account for it as it passes
through their hands along its route. Receipts are required
at all points, and the letters are forwarded in
pouches secured by "rotary locks," provided with certain
numbers running in sequence, controlled mechanically,
the mechanism being such that the lock cannot
be opened without raising the number at which the
lock was set. If the lock is tampered with in transit,
since record is made of the number set when it was
despatched, the circumstance is apparent.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Division of Money-orders and the Postal Savings</i></p>

<p class="indent">The financial transactions of the New York
post-office are of enormous volume. Through its Division of
Money-orders it issues and pays money-orders of a
value comparable with the business of the large banks
of the city. The Postal Savings System also has on
deposit a sum which is exceeded by the deposits of
only nine savings-banks in Manhattan, and is operated
as part of the organization of the Division of Money-orders.</p>

<p class="indent">This division is under the supervision of Mr. Albert
Firmin, who has been connected with the postal system
within a few months of forty years, and in point
of service is dean among the division heads. It has
been through Mr. Firmin's especial assistance that we
have been able to obtain so complete a story of the New
York post-office, although every office and every executive
has co√∂perated in every possible way, for which extended
courtesies we hereby make grateful acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The New York post-office issues more
money-orders than any office in the United States. The volume
of money-order business, domestic and international,
for the last five years, is shown below:</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">During the fiscal year last past,
722,321 international money-orders, amounting to $9,583,425.62,
were certified to foreign countries, and 112,292 such
orders were certified from foreign countries to the United States,
the total amount of these being $1,802,902.66.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Occasionally in excess of 100,000 money-orders
are paid in a single day, and it is the rule that this volume
of business must be balanced to a cent daily.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The employees engaged in handling these millions
of orders are held strictly accountable for the accuracy
of their work, and if error occurs resulting in loss,
it must be borne by the person at fault.</p>

<p class="indent">The most modern methods of accounting are
in use, mechanical labor-aiding equipment being utilized
wherever it is practicable. The method followed is to
perforate a card by means of a small electric machine,
so that the perforations show the various data upon
the paid money-order that are required to record the
payment, the amount, etc. These machines are operated
by skilled women employees, trained in methods
of accuracy and speed, and whose rating and advancement
depend on their efficiency.</p>

<p class="indent">The cards are then fed into electrically-driven
adding- and printing-machines, known as tabulators,
which automatically print upon sheets, in columns,
all the data shown by the perforations in the card.
From this machine the cards are transferred to sorting
machines, which operate at great speed and automatically
set the cards up numerically according to the
numbers of the offices which issued them. Thereupon
other sheets are printed by the tabulators showing the
orders in their new and correct numerical sequence,
these sheets being used for searching purposes in the
event of applications being made for duplicates, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Various other mechanical devices are employed
in other branches of the work, and the equipment is in
all respects up to date, and minimizes clerical work to
the greatest extent.

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Country's Foreign Exchange Clearing-House</i></p>

<p class="indent">In addition to the work which is usually done
in a post-office in the issue and payment of money-orders,
the New York post-office is the International Exchange
Office for the United States, handling all
money-orders passing between this country and Europe,
South America, Africa, etc. The volume of this
business has been materially reduced since the war,
and is affected by the unsettled condition of the old
world finances, but it is nevertheless large, as shown
by the figures given below for the last fiscal year.</p>

<p class="indent">The duty of purchasing foreign exchange also falls
upon the New York post-office, and the transactions
in this are at times very heavy. The total financial
transactions of the Division of Money-orders, exclusive
of the postal savings, amounted last year to
$235,133,669.03.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Postal Savings</i></p>

<p class="indent">At practically all the stations of the New York
office there are postal-savings depositories which are open
to the public from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. The rate of interest
on postal savings is but two per cent., but the advantage
of absolute safety which the system affords appeals
to those who utilize it. Not more than $2500 is
accepted from one depositor, but a deposit as small as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
one dollar is accepted, and this may even be accumulated
by the purchase of ten-cent postal-savings
stamps, which are obtainable at all stations.</p>

<p class="indent">New York has on deposit close to one third
of all the postal-savings deposits in the United States.
There are approximately 140,000 depositors in Manhattan
and the Bronx, and they have to their credit in
excess of $44,000,000. Thus it will be seen that the
New York office is not only a colossus among post-offices,
viewed from the standpoint of postal facilities
and postal business, but that as a financial institution
as well it is a giant.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Office of the Cashier</i></p>

<p class="indent">The cashier is the disbursing officer of the
New York office, and he likewise receives all money derived from
the sale of postage-stamps, stamped envelops, postal
cards, and internal revenue stamps which are disposed
of at the different stations and in all the third-and
fourth-class post-offices in thirty-five counties in the
State of New York. The cashier is Mr. E. P. Russell,
and his financial responsibilities are great. The New
York post-office is the depository for surplus postal
funds from all first-and second-class post-offices in
New York State, and it likewise provides hundreds of
offices with treasury savings stamps and certificates,
and accounts for the revenue received therefrom.
How great is the volume of business of the cashier's
office will be seen from the statistics given below,
which are for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1922.

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Pay-roll Worries of Magnitude</i></p>

<p class="indent">The cashier's office pays the salaries of the
15,000 employees of the New York office, which in the last fiscal
year amounted to $23,594,824.60. It also pays many
of the employees of the Railway Mail Service, this salary
list for the year totaling $5,103,717.11; also all the
rural delivery carriers in New York State, their earnings
being $3,394,540.56 for the year.</p>

<p class="indent">A feature of the parcel-post system is the
indemnity which is paid in the case of damage or loss to insured
parcels. When applications for indemnities are received
from the public they are investigated by the
Inquiry Section, and when it is determined that payment
should be made, the cashier's office makes the
disbursement. Approximately 200 drafts are drawn
daily to cover these cases.</p>

<p class="indent">Mention has been made of treasury savings
certificates handled by the New York office, which in the
month of July were sold to the value of about $600,000.
These certificates, as the name indicates, while issued
by the Treasury Department are handled largely by
the Post-office Department as a convenience to the
public and in the interest of the government to better
promote the sales.</p>

<p class="indent">The large amount of one month's sales indicates the
measure of service thus provided and the extent to which it is used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Office of the Auditor</i></p>

<p class="indent">The auditor is the checking officer of all receipts
and disbursements of the New York post-office. The position
is held by Mr. Justus W. Salzmann, another postal
veteran, and his corps audits the postal, money-order,
and postal-savings accounts, prepares statements of
these accounts for transmission to the comptroller of
the Post-office Department, and verifies the money-order
and postal accounts of mail clerks in charge of
post-offices on naval vessels. He also audits the accounts
of approximately 1400 post-offices in the State
of New York known as "district offices," of which New
York City is the Central Accounting office, and he corresponds
with the postmasters of these offices in connection
with the conduct of their offices.</p>

<p class="indent">The auditor also supervises the examination of
financial accounts at the main office and at all stations, made
by station examiners, corresponds with and prepares
statements for the Commissioner of Pensions in connection
with refunds under the Retirement Act, and
with the United States Employees' Compensation Commission
in connection with injuries sustained by employees
while on duty. He has charge of contracts requiring
expenditures, as well as correspondence relating
to leases of post-office stations and to repairs and additional
equipment required at these stations.</p>

<p class="indent">The organization of the auditor's office is divided
into two sections, each under the supervision of a bookkeeper;
one has charge of the general accounts of the
New York office and the accounts of district post-offices;
the other has charge of the auditing of the
money-order and postal-savings accounts, the preparation
and verification of pay-rolls, and second-class and
permit-matter accounts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The auditor has immediate charge of six station
examiners who report on the financial accounts of all
stations; they also investigate and report on the need
for establishing and maintaining contract stations and
attend to complaints received concerning the operation
of such stations.</p>

<p class="indent">The auditor, as the checking officer of the New
York post-office, audits receipts and disbursements totaling
over $700,000,000 annually. The postal receipts for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1922, were $54,089,023.99,
as compared with $52,292,433.91 for the previous fiscal
year, a gain of $1,796,590.08.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Appointment Section</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Appointment Section corresponds to a well-organized
personnel bureau of a modern business establishment.
This section is under the superintendency of
Mr. Peter Putz. All appointees from the Civil Service
list report to this section, and from here they are assigned
to the various divisions and departments, according
to the requirements. In a force of 15,000 men
there are, of course, many changes daily, caused by
deaths, resignations, promotions, and demotions.
Whatever action is involved in the changes is taken by
the Appointment Section. The efficiency records of all
employees are filed here, and likewise the bonds covering
their financial responsibility. From the day a person
enters the service to the time he or she leaves it, a
record is kept of all ratings, of qualifications as determined
by his superior officers, and of all delinquencies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Drafting Section</i></p>

<p class="indent">How diversified the requirements of the postal
service are is illustrated by the work of the Drafting Section,
under the direction of Mr. John T. Rathbun, whose
corps of draftsmen are constantly engaged in laying
out new stations, replotting equipment in different
units as various changes incident to the growth of the
city necessitate, or as changes in the regulations affect
the volume of business at different points. This section
includes also a corps of mechanics engaged in the
repair and maintenance of mail-handling apparatus
and equipment.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Supply Department</i></p>

<p class="indent">The Supply Department of the New York post-office
corresponds to a well-equipped store and printing
establishment. It is under the superintendency of Mr.
William Gibson. By this division supplies are furnished
not only to the New York office and its stations,
including those on naval vessels, but to post-offices
throughout New York State, as many as 2200 points in
all being cared for. Among the items supplied are
5,000,000 penalty envelops and 1700 different varieties
of forms and books, of which approximately 60,000,000
copies are used annually. This department furnishes
250 different items of stationery and of janitors' supplies,
and innumerable repair parts for a great variety
of mechanical contrivances used in the postal system.
The aim of the official in charge of the department is
to keep in touch with the latest labor-aiding mechanical
devices that can be utilized in the service, and among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the various bureaus and sections will be found more
than 300 type-writers, eighty adding-machines, cancelling
machines, check-writing, check-protecting, accounting,
and duplicating machines. For these numerous
repairs are required and parts have to be secured,
all of which is attended to by this department.</p>

<p class="indent">A feature of this department is a well-equipped
printing section, which prints a daily paper or bulletin containing
instructions, orders, and information for the
employees, as well as numerous forms, posters, placards,
etc., utilizing in this work a monotype type-setting
machine, two cylinder and five job presses. A
detail in its workshop is the precancellation of postage-stamps,
to meet the requirements of large mailers who
desire to purchase them, of which the yearly output is
approximately 250,000,000.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Classification Section</i></p>

<p class="indent">In the Division of Classification all questions
involving rates and conditions of mailing are passed upon. At
the head of this section is Mr. Frederick G. Mulker,
whose experience with these matters is probably unequaled.</p>

<p class="indent">All applications for the entry of publications
as "second-class" matter are handled here, and to this
bureau publishers come to arrange for the acceptance
of their magazines and papers. After a publication is
admitted to the mails at the second-class rate its columns
are scrutinized to detect anything that infringes
upon the regulations, and if anything is found, action
is taken by this section. The law defines various classes
of mail matter, and innumerable questions arise as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the class in which certain articles belong, many of the
questions being difficult of determination and involving
numerous technicalities, but here, sooner or later, all
questions are settled.</p>

<p class="indent">It is to this point, also, that the public comes
for information as to the preparation of matter for the mails,
how it should be wrapped, addressed, and posted; this
section passes upon the mailability of matter under the
lottery laws, which cover everything relating to prize
schemes, contests, competitions, drawings, endless-chain
schemes, etc. Many are the plans submitted, and
while the law is rigid in respect to these matters, the
field is alluring, and each day some novel proposition
is submitted with the hope that it will not infringe the
law, yet be attractive to the public through some subtle
appeal to its gambling proclivity.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Inquiry Department</i></p>

<p class="indent">This is one of the most interesting departments
of any post-office. The one at New York is under the supervision
of Mr. William T. Gutgsell, and its functions are
many. It handles all inquiries for missing mail, and
during the year ended June 30, 1922, this amounted
to 243,457. The number of inquiries, however, by no
means equals the number of letters and packages which
are found to be undeliverable. Undeliverable mail is
disposed of by the Inquiry Section, and the magnitude
of its work may be appreciated from the fact that no
fewer than 150,000 letters were mailed without postage
during the year. Among the other items that loom
large in the report of the Inquiry Department is the
number of letters directed to hotels which were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
claimed by the addressees. Of these there were 1,200,000;
18,000 parcels of fourth-class matter were found
without address, the delivery of which could not be
effected, and 56,000 pieces of unaddressed matter were
restored to the owners. In former years all letters and
packages of value found to be undeliverable throughout
the country and not provided with the cards of the
senders were forwarded to the Division of Dead Letters
at Washington, but on January 1, 1917, branch
dead-letter offices were established at New York, Chicago,
and San Francisco. The branch at New York is
conducted by the Inquiry Section, and its work concerns
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York, 5074 offices
being included. From this area last year there were
received 3,518,604 pieces of undeliverable matter of
domestic origin. A very large part of this mail had
to be opened in order that restoration to the owners
could be effected. Many of the letters, etc., were found
to contain valuable enclosures, as indicated by this tabulation:</p>

<p class="f110 space-above2">OPENED DEAD MAIL WITH VALUABLE<br />ENCLOSURES</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="indent space-above1">Many letters found to contain drafts,
checks, money-orders, etc., are restored to the owners, for if the
contents do not themselves disclose the address of the
owners, the banks upon which the checks are drawn are
communicated with to secure the information desired.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Inquiry Department includes the Indemnity
Bureau, which reviews, adjusts, and pays claims involving
loss or damage to insured or C. O. D. parcels.
Of these claims 112,432 were filed during the last
fiscal year, and the amount paid on the claims was
$544,314.46.</p>

<p>Another bureau of this department is charged with
the duty of examining all misdirected letters and parcels
which cannot be distributed or delivered by the
employees regularly engaged in sorting the mails. The
carelessness of the public in the matter of addressing
mail is apparent from the statistics of this bureau for
the year just passed, which show that it handled
1,576,366 letters with the very creditable result that of
this number it succeeded in correcting and forwarding
686,233, from which it is evident that the post-office
took more pains than did the senders. Of the number
handled it also restored to the senders approximately 424,000.</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Order and Instruction Section</i></p>

<p class="indent">This department is under the supervision of
Mr. Edward R. McAlarney and is maintained for the issuance
of various bulletins of information, public announcements,
news items, and the circulation through official
publications of instructions, orders, and intelligence regarding
postal matters. It is "the office of publication"
to the post-office; it issues posters, bulletins, news of
the service, notices announcing the change in rates and
conditions, the sailing and arriving of ships, changes in
time of despatch and routing of the mail, etc. It is a
busy department and the magnitude of its service corresponds
to the great volume of work that it performs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>The Examination Section</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">How the Employees are Trained</span></p>

<p class="indent">A survey of the post-office quickly illustrates
the fact that it could only be successfully conducted by the
agency of skilled employees, especially trained for the
work. The distribution of the mail is dependent upon
employees who certainly must closely apply themselves
to the mastery of the schemes of separation, and we
should imagine that these are rather tedious to study,
for it seems to be largely a matter of "grind" and memory
taxation regarding absolutely unrelated names and
places, times of train departures, etc. It is a work to
which men must devote a good part of their lives and
must have constant practice in order to maintain speed,
and the duty of standing eight hours a day in front of
a case and boxing letters by the thousand, year in and
year out, must sometimes be closely akin to drudgery.
To add to the difficulties of these men there are constant
changes in the list of post-offices, in the timetables,
etc., so that a scheme of separation is no sooner
mastered than it is necessary to memorize new changes.</p>

<p class="indent">A department devoted to the training of the
employees engaged in this work is known as the "Examination
Section," and is under the supervision of Mr.
H. S. McLean. As soon as a substitute is appointed
he is sent to this section, where he is drilled in the
fundamentals, in the rules and regulations, and in proper
methods of performing the duties ordinarily performed
by new employees. Later the employees are graduated
to practical work, and are assigned certain schemes
to study on which they are examined from time to
time and required to attain a certain standard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
proficiency to justify their retention and advancement in
the service. In the examinations, which continue as
long as the employees are engaged in the distribution
of mail, they are tested not only as to accuracy but as
to speed, and if an employee fails to maintain the
required efficiency, demotion follows.</p>

<p class="indent">A feature of the work is the endeavor to
impress upon the employee the importance of his employment,
the necessity for devoting to it his best efforts and of
not only maintaining but improving the standard.</p>

<p class="indent">The following statistics in a way show the extent of this work:</p>

This council considers all matters pertaining to
the welfare of the employees and makes recommendations
in regard to them to the postmaster.</p>

<p class="indent">At the General Post-office there has been
established a clinic of the Government Health Service. This
clinic is equipped with an operating table, surgical instruments
and supplies, two cots, and the other appurtenances
of a first-class dispensary. Three doctors and
three nurses are in attendance. The clinic is open
throughout the twenty-four hours with the exception
of a short interval at night. Approximately fifty patients
are treated each day and without charge.</p>

<p class="indent">The employees also own and operate a co√∂perative
store and cafeteria in the general office, and among the
terminals and stations there are numerous other similar
undertakings.</p>

<p class="indent">The employees also maintain numerous associations
formed to better their conditions. Several of these include
sick benefits, insurance features, etc. Some of
these organizations are of national extent, others are
local; every station and department has its own association
